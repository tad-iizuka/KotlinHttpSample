# KotlinHttpSample

Kotlin HTTP GET/POST sample code

Note: I think that this code will be unnecessity when the Coroutines become officially available. :)

This sample code is a HTTP client Android application written by Kotlin. Each connection doing in async.

* GET: JSON Array
* POST: JSON, server echo back JSON
